# Thats Hot
### The best game to feature Will Smith

## How it works
This project uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library created and maintained by the [processing foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) throughout the majority of the program. p5 provides an eligant solution to creative programming. It allows for ideas to be concieved and put into action with a minimal amount of code. This makes it very useful when attempting to create a game or another piece of interactive digital art.
